Generate a complete implementation for the Task Management REST API based on the architecture decisions.

You MUST create actual files in the output/service/ directory. Generate a bash script that creates these files:

1. **output/service/app.py** - Main Flask application with Lambda handler
   - Implement all CRUD endpoints: POST /tasks, GET /tasks, GET /tasks/{id}, PUT /tasks/{id}, DELETE /tasks/{id}
   - DynamoDB integration using boto3
   - Proper error handling and HTTP status codes
   - Input validation

2. **output/service/requirements.txt** - Python dependencies
   - Flask, boto3, and any other needed packages

3. **output/service/README.md** - Deployment and usage instructions

Generate and execute bash commands to create these files using cat and heredocs.
Create the directory structure first with: mkdir -p output/service
Then create each file using: cat > filename << 'EOF' ... EOF

Make the code production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and documentation.
Execute all operations fully automated without asking for any manual input.
