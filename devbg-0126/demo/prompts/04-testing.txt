Generate comprehensive tests for the Task Management API.

You MUST create actual files in the output/service/tests/ directory. Generate a bash script that creates these files:

1. **output/service/tests/test_app.py** - Unit and integration tests
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Test error cases (invalid input, not found, etc.)
   - Test DynamoDB interactions (mock with moto)
   - Test input validation
   - Aim for 80%+ code coverage

2. **output/service/test-requirements.txt** - Testing dependencies
   - pytest, moto (for AWS mocking), pytest-cov

Generate and execute bash commands to create these files using cat and heredocs.
Create the directory structure first with: mkdir -p output/service/tests
Then create each file using: cat > filename << 'EOF' ... EOF

Include:
- Fixtures for test data
- Proper setup/teardown
- Clear test names and documentation
- Both positive and negative test cases

Execute all operations fully automated without asking for any manual input.
