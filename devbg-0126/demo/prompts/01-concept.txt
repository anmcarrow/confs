I need to create a simple Task Management REST API service.

Requirements:
- Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Each task has: id, title, description, status (todo/in-progress/done), created_at, updated_at
- API should follow REST principles
- Use Python with Flask framework
- Store data in DynamoDB
- Deploy as AWS Lambda function with API Gateway

Please analyze this concept and provide:
1. A clear problem statement
2. Core functional requirements (5-7 bullet points)
3. Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability)
4. Success criteria

Format the output as a structured requirements document.
Run all operations fully automated and wihout asking for any manual input.
